## Inspiration
Once upon a time, a village is invaded by an extraterrestrial robot, Galatron. Upon leaving, he took away the most valuable things in the village, board games. While the inhabitants of the village are filled with sadness, a brave warrior named Ryu has decided to step up and go on a quest to bring back the games. To do that, he needs to beat Galatron in four famous board games on planet Xamos, Opus, Icrozar and Duex resp. Letâ€™s see if he can beat the robots! 

## What it does

Our protagonist Ryu has to go to the planets Opus, Duex, Xamos, and Icrozar to beat Galatron in Tic-Tac-Toe, Breakout, Connect 4, and Chess respectively in order to retrieve the stolen board games. 

## Tech Stack

## What's next for Ryu's Conquest

We believe that this Project possesses tremendous potential and can be taken forward. We can add Time Clock along with escalation in game difficulties for enhancing user experience. Also we need not restrict ourselves to only four planets and incorporate new games.
